**The Knight:** His melee attacks are fast, and he has high mobility.
**The Archer:** His high mobility and ranged attacks make him almost untouchable.
**The Paladin:** He is very slow but hits hard, using his shield for strong defense.
**The Mage:** Using magic, he creates damage zones, can hover in the air, and generate a shield that reduces incoming damage.

## Arenas
The 3 arenas each have their own unique mechanics:

**Ice Arena:** The ground is slippery and tilts based on the players' positions.

**Falling Arena:** The floor is a bridge whose planks fall one by one as the game progresses. Swords also fall from the ceiling.

**Gravity Arena:** Occasionally, gravity changes, forcing players to fight upside down on the ceiling.
